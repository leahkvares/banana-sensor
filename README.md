# Banana Ripeness Identifier

This project categorizes an image of a banana as either unripe, ripe, or overripe. It can be utilized by grocery stores or fruit suppliers in order to manage which bananas should be discarded, stocked, etc. and streamline the process of banana-selling.

## The Algorithm

The program was trained over 50 epochs so that it can recognize bananas from many different images. It is able to categorize their ripeness with a percentage certainty in each category.

## Running this project

1. Upload the H5 file included in this repository. This is the trained image model that will identify the banana's ripeness.
2. Upload a clear image of a banana. When prompted, input the exact file name of the image. The program will output the banana's ripeness, along with the percentage certainty.
